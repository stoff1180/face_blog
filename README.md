Project title: 
Improving User-Generated Content Management: Secure Post Management with Access Control Mechanisms Inspired by Social Media Platforms
 Introduction:
In the contemporary digital landscape, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become integral parts of our daily lives, enabling users to connect, share information, and express themselves. Central to the functionality of these platforms is the ability for users to create, update, and delete their posts. However, ensuring the security and integrity of user-generated content while preventing unauthorized access and tampering poses a significant challenge. This proposal aims to address this challenge by proposing a system that enables users to manage their posts securely, while implementing access control mechanisms similar to those found on Twitter and Facebook to prevent users from updating posts that do not belong to them.

Objectives:
The primary objectives of this research are as follows:
To design and develop a system that allows users to create, update, and delete posts securely, akin to the functionalities present on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
To implement access control mechanisms inspired by these platforms to prevent unauthorized users from modifying posts that do not belong to them.
To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed system through user testing and feedback, comparing it with the functionalities of existing social media platforms.
